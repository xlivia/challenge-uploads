# Olivia's VBA Excel Assignment
## UofT Data Analytics Bootcamp Module 2 Challenge 

alphabetical_testing was for testing VBA code

Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx has the results in excel

Multiple_year_stock_data_vba_code.vba has the code I used to generate the responses.

1. run sub typvchanges() on each sheet to generate the yearly and percent change and total volume for each stock
2. run sub greatestvalues() on each sheet to find the max and min of percent change and max of total stock volume

Note: the number after the "To" in the "for loops" needs to be switched out with the appropriate length of data entries for each sheet.
Note: The number of entries for each sheet is listed in a comment in the code.
